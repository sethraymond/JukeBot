This is JukeBot!

This bot requires >= Python 3.5.1. You will probably need root access for a
majority of these commands.

Get the repository for Python 3.5.x if you don't have it:
$ add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes
$ apt-get update

$ apt-get install python3.5 python3.5-dev
$ apt-get install python3-pip

avconv is required for this project, you can get it through libav-tools:

$ apt-get install libav-tools
$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/avconv

Check your symbolic links in /usr/bin to see if python3 points to an older
version of python3 (like python3.4.x).

$ ls /usr/bin/ *python3*

If necessary... USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION. WE TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY IF THIS HAS
ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES!

$ sudo rm python3
$ sudo ln -s python3 python3.5


Now that we have pip, we can start cruising.

$ pip3 install --upgrade pip
$ pip3 install gmusicapi
$ pip3 install youtube-dl

discord.py developers recommend calling python3 directly for their pip
installation:

$ python3 -m pip install -U discord.py[voice]
